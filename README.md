# DPFNet: A Dual-branch Dilated Network with Phase-aware Fourier Convolution for Low-Light Image Enhancement
We public the network source code and datasets for the DPFNet.

### Datasets

We evaluated the performance of our method on two paired public datasets, including the LOL dataset and the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset. 

To further validate the capability of our model, we test the samples in four no paired datasets (including MEF, NPE, DICM and VV) 

##### train datasets:

###### MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset

- paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5995413
- data: http://data.csail.mit.edu/graphics/fivek/

###### LOL dataset

- paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04560

### Network

DPFNet network structure in **./model** folder. The specific training code will be made public after the work is officially published
